Discuss in your teams what a decentralised version of a game like monopoly would be like, if there was no software on a central server.

Consider:

  * What are the essential pieces of functionality?
  * How would people cheat?
  * How could you prevent them from cheating?

This is just a general discussion, there is no need to write any code or do any detailed design.





ANSWER:


Essential pieces of functionality:
* Bank 
* Real estate 


How to cheat: 
* Donâ€™t pay rent 
* Steal money from bank
* Steal real estate 

How to make it decentralised:
* All players should keep track on a piece of paper of the money and real estate card everyone as and vote to agree or disagree on each transaction
